# Flask Allowed Hosts

Flask Allowed Hosts is a Flask extension that provides host validation for API endpoints. It allows you to enforce that requests are only accepted from specific hosts, providing an additional layer of security for your Flask application.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```cmd
pip install flask-allowedhosts
```

## Getting Started

To limit access to your routes using `flask-allowedhosts` follow these simple steps:

1. Import the `limit_hosts` decorator from flask_allowedhosts.
2. Define the list of allowed hosts.
3. Apply the `@limit_hosts` decorator to the desired endpoint(s).

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_allowedhosts import limit_hosts

app = Flask(__name__)

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']

def on_denied():
    return "Unauthorized access", 401

@app.route("/api/greet")
@limit_hosts(allowed_hosts=ALLOWED_HOSTS, on_denied=on_denied)
def greet_endpoint():
    name = request.args.get("name", "Friend")
    greeting = {"greeting": f"Hello There {name}!"}
    return jsonify(greeting), 200


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

Now only the allowed hosts set in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` can access the protected endpoint(s). Requests from other hosts will receive a 403 Forbidden error.

### Arguments

- `allowed_hosts`: List[str] : Modify this list to include the allowed hosts. The default value is an empty list `[]`, which means requests from all hosts are allowed.

- `on_denied`: Callable: Modify this function to customize the behavior when a request is denied. The default is `None`, which means a 403 Forbidden error is returned.
